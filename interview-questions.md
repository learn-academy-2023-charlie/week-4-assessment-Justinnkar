# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer: 
Object-oriented programming is programming that organizes code into objects, which are instances of classes that encapsulate data and behavior. In functional programming, state is immutable, and functions operate on immutable data, producing new data as output without modifying the original data. Functional programming tends to favor declarative and pure approaches, while OOP provides a more modular and encapsulated way of organizing code.

Researched answer:
OOP emphasizes the concept of objects and their interactions to design and implement software systems. It focuses on concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. Functional programming, on the other hand, is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions. In functional programming, functions are treated as first-class citizens, meaning they can be passed as arguments, returned as values, and stored in variables. It focuses on immutability and avoids changing state and mutable data. Functional programming promotes writing pure functions that don't have side effects.

2. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

Your answer:
A Float is a data type in Ruby that represents decimal numbers with fractional parts, while an Integer is a data type that represents whole numbers without fractional parts.

Researched answer:
 In Ruby, a Float is a data type that represents decimal numbers with fractional parts. It is used to store and manipulate numbers with decimal places. Floats are represented using the floating-point format and can have both positive and negative values. On the other hand, an Integer is a data type in Ruby that represents whole numbers without fractional parts. Integers can be positive, negative, or zero. They are used to perform arithmetic operations and represent counts, indices, and other whole number values.

3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer:
Ruby's implicit return means that the last evaluated expression in a method or block is automatically returned as the result of that method or block.

Researched answer:
Ruby's implicit return refers to the behavior where the last evaluated expression in a method or block is automatically returned as the result of that method or block without explicitly using the return keyword. This means that if a method or block does not explicitly specify a return value using return, the value of the last expression evaluated in that method or block will be returned as the result.

4. What is a block in Ruby?

Your answer:
A block in Ruby is a piece of code that can be passed as an argument to a method. It is enclosed within curly braces or do end keywords. Blocks can contain multiple lines of code and are often used for iteration and defining behavior within a method call.

Researched answer:
In Ruby, a block is a piece of code that can be passed to methods as an argument. It is a way to group multiple lines of code together and pass them around as a single unit. Blocks are typically delimited by either curly braces or the do end keywords.

5. How do you extract a value in a Ruby hash?

Your answer:
To extract a value from a Ruby hash, you can use the square bracket notation ([]) or the fetch method, providing the key corresponding to the desired value.

Researched answer:
In Ruby, you can extract a value from a hash by using the square bracket notation ([]) or the fetch method, passing in the key that corresponds to the desired value.
